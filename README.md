# Customer Loyalty and Retail Sales Insights Using MySQL and PowerBI 

This Project focuses on analyzing retail Sales and Customer loyalty Behaviour 
using a relational Database. I used **Mysql** for data quering and **PowerBI**
For Creating an interactive Dashboard. The Dataset consist of three related tables:
`Customer`,`Product`, and `Transaction` (2,000 rows total).

## Project Objectives 
- performed **deep SQL analyis** Using Joins and Groupby 
- Uncovered **Insights** about Customer Behaviour and product Performance 
- Built a **Power BI dashboard** for visualization 
- Highlighted Analytical Skills for a **remote data Analyst role**

## Dataset Structure 
| Table         | Description                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `customers`   | Customer details including location, gender, income, loyalty |
| `products`    | Product info like name, category, price |
| `transactions`| Sales data including date, quantity, discount, payment method |
